title: "Functions frequently used"
---

This is an R Markdown document explaining all the functions used by the language and learning lab. 
The functions are stored into the *https://github.com/n400peanuts/languagelearninglab/docs/tools* folder. 

## myCenter

This function outputs the centered values of a variable, which can be a numeric variable, a factor, or a data frame. It was taken from Florian Jaegers blog https://hlplab.wordpress.com/2009/04/27/centering-several-variables/.

From his blog:
-If the input is a numeric variable, the output is the centered variable.
-If the input is a factor, the output is a numeric variable with centered factor level values. That is, the factor's levels are converted into numerical values in their inherent order (if not specified otherwise,  R defaults to alphanumerical order). More specifically, this centers any binary factor so that the value below 0 will be the 1st level of the original factor, and the value above 0 will be the 2nd level.
-If the input is a data frame or matrix, the output is a new matrix of the same dimension and with the centered values and column names that correspond to the colnames() of the input preceded by "c" (e.g. "Variable1" will be "cVariable1").

```{r myCenter,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

myCenter <- function(x) {
  if (is.numeric(x)) { return(x - mean(x, na.rm=T)) }
	if (is.factor(x)) {
		x= as.numeric(x)
		return(x - mean(x, na.rm=T))
	}
	if (is.data.frame(x) || is.matrix(x)) {
		m= matrix(nrow=nrow(x), ncol=ncol(x))
		colnames(m)= paste("c", colnames(x), sep="")
	
		for (i in 1:ncol(x)) {
		
			m[,i]= myCenter(x[,i])
		}
		return(as.data.frame(m))
	}
}
```

## lizCenter

This function provides a wrapper around myCenter allowing to center a specific list of variables from a dataframe.
The input is a dataframe (x) and a list of the names of the variables which you wish to center (listfname).
The output is a copy of the dataframe with a column (numeric) added for each of the centered variables with each one labelled with it's previous name with ".ct" appended. For example, if x is a dataframe with columns "a" and "b" lizCenter(x, list("a", "b")) will return a dataframe with two additional columns, a.ct and b.ct, which are numeric, centered codings of the corresponding variables.

```{r lizCenter,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

lizCenter= function(x, listfname) 
{
	for (i in 1:length(listfname)) 
	{
		fname = as.character(listfname[i])
		x[paste(fname,".ct", sep="")] = myCenter(x[fname])
	}
		
	return(x)
}
```	

## BayesFactor

This function is equivalent to the Dienes (2008) calculator which can be found here: http://www.lifesci.sussex.ac.uk/home/Zoltan_Dienes/inference/Bayes.htm.

The code was provided by Baguely and Kayne (2010) and can be found here: http://www.academia.edu/427288/Review_of_Understanding_psychology_as_a_science_An_introduction_to_scientific_and_statistical_inference

```{r BayesFactor, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

Bf<-function(sd, obtained, uniform, lower=0, upper=1, meanoftheory=0,sdtheory=1, tail=1){
  area <- 0
  if(identical(uniform, 1)){
    theta <- lower
    range <- upper - lower
    incr <- range / 2000
    for (A in -1000:1000){
      theta <- theta + incr
      dist_theta <- 1 / range
      height <- dist_theta * dnorm(obtained, theta, sd)
      area <- area + height * incr
    }
  }else
  {theta <- meanoftheory - 5 * sdtheory
  incr <- sdtheory / 200
  for (A in -1000:1000){
    theta <- theta + incr
    dist_theta <- dnorm(theta, meanoftheory, sdtheory)
    if(identical(tail, 1)){
      if (theta <= 0){
        dist_theta <- 0
      } else {
        dist_theta <- dist_theta * 2
      }
    }
    height <- dist_theta * dnorm(obtained, theta, sd)
    area <- area + height * incr
  }
  }
  LikelihoodTheory <- area
  Likelihoodnull <- dnorm(obtained, 0, sd)
  BayesFactor <- LikelihoodTheory / Likelihoodnull
  ret <- list("LikelihoodTheory" = LikelihoodTheory,"Likelihoodnull" = Likelihoodnull, "BayesFactor" = BayesFactor)
  ret
} 
```

## BayesFactor *updated*

The BF function has been updated recently. The novel function has options for a likelihood that is either normal- or t-distributed, and a model of H1 that is either uniform, or normal or t- (or Cauchy-) distributed, with the normal/t/cauchy models being 1- or 2-tailed. In addition, the 1-tailed models are compatible with any mode (unlike the Dienes, 2008, calculator that assumed that 1-tailed models had a mode of zero).

## Bf_powercalc

```{r Bf_powercalc, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

Bf_powercalc<-function(sd, obtained, uniform, lower=0, upper=1, meanoftheory=0, sdtheory=1, tail=1, N, min, max)
{
  
  x = c(0)
  y = c(0)
  # note: working out what the difference between N and df is (for the contrast between two groups, this is 2; for constraints where there is 4 groups this will be 3, etc.)  
  for(newN in min : max)
  {
    B = as.numeric(Bf(sd = sd*sqrt(N/newN), obtained, uniform, lower, upper, meanoftheory, sdtheory, tail)[3])

    output = cbind(x,y)
    
  }
